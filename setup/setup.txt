Add this to rc.Local
python3 [path to sauna.py] &


Configure xinitrc
sudo nano /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
Comment this line

. /etc/X11/xsession
Add this line to start openbox

exec openbox-session



Step 7: Edit Openbox config
The Openbox window manager will be used to launch the Chromium browser.

When Openbox launches at startup it will run two scripts in the /etc/xdg/openbox folder. The first, environment will setup any environment variables, etc. The second, autostart will setup and launch whatever app you specify.

First I will show you how to edit the autostart file and then how to add environment variables to support it.

Open up autostart in an editor:

sudo nano /etc/xdg/openbox/autostart
Update the autostart file by adding the text below.

First, add commands to turn off power management, screen blanking and screen saving. We don’t want those features in a kiosk.

xset -dpms			# turn off display power management system
xset s noblank		# turn off screen blanking
xset s off			# turn off screen saver
Next if Chromium crashed it may pop up error messages next time it starts. This is another feature that we don’t want in a kiosk.

# Remove exit errors from the config files that could trigger a warning
  
sed -i 's/"exited_cleanly":false/"exited_cleanly":true/' ~/.config/chromium/'Local State'
  
sed -i 's/"exited_cleanly":false/"exited_cleanly":true/; s/"exit_type":"[^"]\+"/"exit_type":"Normal"/' ~/.config/chromium/Default/Preferences
Finally, update autostart to run the Chromium browser in kiosk mode. Pass in an environment variable ($KIOSK_URL) that contains the URL of the Web app to launch.

# Run Chromium in kiosk mode
chromium-browser  --noerrdialogs --disable-infobars --kiosk $KIOSK_URL
In the next step, I will show you how to set $KIOSK_URL.

To save the autostart file in nano, press Ctrl-o, hit enter, then press Ctrl-X.

Step 8. Setup the environment
Edit the Openbox environment file:

sudo nano /etc/xdg/openbox/environment
Add the KIOSK_URL to the file:

export KIOSK_URL=https://desertbot.io
This is so that you can change the URL simply by remote-logging in, editing the environment file and rebooting.

Step 9. Start the X server on boot
See if ~/.bash_profile already exists:

ls -la ~/.bash_profile
If NOT, then create an empty version:

touch ~/.bash_profile
Edit ~/.bash_profile:

sudo nano ~/.bash_profile
Add this line to start the X server on boot. Because I am using a touch screen I’m passing in the flag to remove the cursor.

[[ -z $DISPLAY && $XDG_VTNR -eq 1 ]] && startx -- -nocursor
Save and exit the file by pressing Ctrl-o, enter, Ctrl-X.

From the command line run:

source ~/.bash_profile
If you had no errors, reboot

sudo reboot
After the server runs through its startup sequence, the browser should be launched and fill the whole screen.
